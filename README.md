This version of mindnetwork adopts [PostgreSQL] as database instead of MongoDB, which makes it possible to be deployed on [heroku] with free postgresql services. Click [me](http://mindnetwork.heroku.com) to visit the published website. You will find that the page takes more time at the initial loading while the add and remove operations of node and edge take fewer time. That is mainly caused by that heroku website is not stable to visit in China but it provides quite stable database services.
