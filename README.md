This branch of MindNetwork is developed on Sina App Engine([SAE]). The server side uses PHP and MySQL while the client side keeps using AJAX to request data from the server. Now I find that SAE version responses very quickly to the HTTP request than the other branches. Unfortunately, SAE does not support Node.js now. That is why I did not choose SAE as a priority platform. But later I find that the response time is a more critical factor. Through the development in the last week, I learned that in China, a developer would better use platforms directly provided by Chinese instead of international platforms provided by Google, Amazon or Heroku.
